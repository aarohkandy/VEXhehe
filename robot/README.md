# Robot Workspace

This folder is for robot-code planning and implementation work only.

- `sim/` is reserved for the simulation agent.
- Hardware ports used by PROS code are centralized in `include/robot/ports.h`.
- Once the simulation-side ports file path is confirmed, we can mirror those exact values here.
